# Vendor Sales & Profitability Analytics System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analytics solution designed to evaluate vendor performance, profitability, pricing efficiency, and inventory turnover using real-world transactional data. The system consolidates purchase, sales, freight, and pricing datasets into analytical summary tables and generates actionable business insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical validation.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- Analyze vendor-wise sales and profitability performance  
- Detect loss-making transactions and slow-moving inventory  
- Evaluate pricing efficiency and bulk purchasing advantages  
- Identify supply chain dependency risks  
- Provide data-driven business recommendations  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- SQLite  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- SQL (CTEs, Joins, Aggregations)  
- Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes vendor purchase records, sales transactions, freight charges, pricing slabs, and inventory metrics. These datasets are merged into vendor summary tables to enable comprehensive vendor performance analytics.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Filtered inconsistent and loss-making data  
- Conducted correlation analysis on pricing, profit margin, and stock turnover  
- Identified slow-moving inventory worth ₹2.71M  
- Evaluated bulk purchase cost benefits and vendor dependency risks  
- Applied hypothesis testing to validate profit-margin differences  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Top 10 vendors contribute 65.69% of total purchases  
- Bulk purchasing reduces unit cost by 72%  
- Pricing inefficiencies observed across vendors  
- Low-performing vendors maintain higher margins but low volumes  
- Inventory optimization opportunities identified  

---

## 🧠 Business Recommendations
- Re-optimize pricing for low-volume, high-margin brands  
- Diversify vendor sourcing to reduce supply chain risk  
- Leverage bulk purchasing for cost efficiency  
- Improve inventory turnover using clearance and demand planning  
- Strengthen marketing and distribution for underperforming vendors
